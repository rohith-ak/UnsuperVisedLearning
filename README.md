In this repository, there are few projects which are related to Kmeans clustering, isolation forest, PCA

# Project 1
## DOMAIN: Automobile
## CONTEXT: The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes
## DATA DESCRIPTION: The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon
Attribute Information:
  mpg: continuous
  cylinders: multi-valued discrete
  displacement: continuous
  horsepower: continuous  
  weight: continuous
  acceleration: continuous
  model year: multi-valued discrete 
  origin: multi-valued discrete
  car name: string (unique for each instance)
## PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Goal is to cluster the data and treat them as individual datasets to train Regression models to predict ‘mpg’

# Project 2
DOMAIN: Manufacturing
CONTEXT: Company X curates and packages wine across various vineyards spread throughout the country.
DATA DESCRIPTION: The data concerns the chemical composition of the wine and its respective quality.
Attribute Information:

  A, B, C, D: specific chemical composition measure of the wine
  Quality: quality of wine
  
PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Goal is to build a synthetic data generation model using the existing data provided by the company.
